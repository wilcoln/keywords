    "text": "## Summary\n\n**Ronald Wilson Reagan**  (/\u02c8re\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ RAY-g\u0259n; February 6, 1911 to June 5, 2004) was an American politician who\nserved as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern\nconservatism. Prior to his presidency, he was a Hollywood movie actor and union leader before serving as the 33rd\ngovernor of California from 1967 to 1975.\n\nRaised in a low-income family in small towns of northern Illinois, Reagan graduated from Eureka\nCollege in 1932 and worked as a radio sports commentator. After moving to California in 1937,\nhe found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions. \nAs president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan worked to root out alleged communist influence.\nIn the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories. \nIn 1964, his speech \"A Time for Choosing\" earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman.\nBuilding a network  of supporters, Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. \nAs governor, he raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus,\nchallenged the protesters at UC Berkeley, and ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements.\n\nIn 1980, Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the\nincumbent president, Jimmy Carter. At 69 years, 349 days of age at the time of his\nfirst inauguration, Reagan was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency, a\ndistinction he held until 2017, when Donald Trump was inaugurated at age 70 years, 220 days. Reagan faced former vice\npresident Walter Mondale when he ran for re-election in 1984 and defeated him, \nwinning the most electoral votes of any U.S. president, 525, or 97.6% of the 538 votes in the Electoral College.\nIt was the second-most lopsided presidential election in modern U.S. history after Franklin D. Roosevelt's\n1936 victory over Alfred M. Landon, in which he won 98.5%, or 523, of the (then-total) 531 electoral votes.\n\nSoon after taking office as president, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives.\nHis supply-side economic policies, dubbed \"Reaganomics\", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth,\neconomic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term,\nhe survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, invaded Grenada, and fought public sector labor unions.\nOver his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%\nand an average real GDP annual growth of 3.4%.\nReagan enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending,\nwhich contributed to increased federal debt overall. Foreign affairs dominated his second term,\nincluding the bombing of Libya, the Iran--Iraq War, the Iran--Contra affair, and the ongoing Cold War.\nIn June 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an \"evil empire\", Reagan challenged Soviet\nGeneral Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall!\", during a speech at the\nBrandenburg Gate. He transitioned Cold War policy from d\u00e9tente to rollback by escalating an arms\nrace with the USSR while engaging in talks with\nGorbachev. The talks culminated in the INF\nTreaty, which shrank both countries' nuclear\narsenals. Reagan began his presidency during the decline of the Soviet\nUnion, which ultimately collapsed\nnearly three years after he left office.\n\nWhen Reagan left office in 1989, he held an approval rating of 68%,\nmatching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, as the highest ratings for departing\npresidents in the modern era. He was the first president since\nDwight D. Eisenhower to serve two\nfull terms, after the five prior presidents did not. Although he had\nplanned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in November 1994\nthat he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's\ndisease earlier that year. Afterward,\nhis informal public appearances became more infrequent as the disease\nprogressed. He died at home on June 5, 2004. His tenure constituted a\nrealignment toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is an icon among conservatives.\nEvaluations of his presidency among historians and the general public place him among the upper tier of American\npresidents.\n",

He was the younger son of\nNelle Clyde (n\u00e9e Wilson) and Jack Reagan. Jack was a salesman and storyteller\nwhose grandparents were Irish Catholic emigrants from County Tipperary,\nwhile Nelle was of English and Scottish descent. Ronald's older brother, Neil Reagan, became an advertising executive.\n\nReagan's father nicknamed his son \"Dutch\", due to his \"fat little\nDutchman\" appearance and Dutch-boy haircut; the nickname stuck with him\nthroughout his youth. Reagan's family briefly lived in several\ntowns and cities in Illinois, including Monmouth, Galesburg, and Chicago. In 1919,\nthey returned to Tampico and lived above the H. C. Pitney Variety Store until finally settling in\nDixon, Illinois. After his election as president, Reagan lived in the upstairs White House private quarters,\nand he would quip that he was \"living above the store\" again.\n",

    "text": "### Radio and film \n\nAfter graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan took jobs in Iowa as a\nradio announcer at several stations. He moved to WHO as an announcer for Chicago Cubs baseball\ngames. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using\nonly basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.\n\nWhile traveling with the Cubs in California in 1937, Reagan took a\nscreen test that led to a seven-year contract with Warner\nBros. studios. He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the \"B film\" unit,\nwhere, Reagan joked, the producers \"didn't want them good; they wanted them Thursday\".\n\nHe earned his first screen credit with a starring role in the 1937 movie\n*Love Is on the Air*, and by the end of 1939, he had already appeared in 19 films, including *Dark\nVictory* with Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart. Before the film *Santa Fe Trail* with Errol\nFlynn in 1940, he played the role of George Gipp in the film *Knute Rockne, All American*; from it, he acquired\nthe lifelong nickname \"the Gipper\". \nIn 1941, exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.\n\nReagan played his favorite acting role in 1942's *Kings Row*, where he plays a double amputee who\nrecites the line \"Where's the rest of me?\"---later used as the title\nof his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics considered *Kings Row* to\nbe his best movie, though the film was condemned by *The New York Times* critic Bosley Crowther.\n\n*Kings Row* made Reagan a star---Warner immediately tripled his salary\nto $3,000 a week. Shortly afterwards, he received co-star\nabove-the-title billing with Flynn -- who was still a huge star at the\ntime -- in *Desperate Journey.\nIn April 1942, Reagan was ordered to military active duty in San\nFrancisco and never quite became a big first-rank film star despite\nplaying the lead in numerous movies. After his wartime military\nservice he co-starred in such films as *The Voice of the Turtle*, *John Loves Mary*, *The Hasty Heart*,\n*Bedtime for Bonzo*, *Cattle Queen of Montana*, *Tennessee's Partner*, *Hellcats of the Navy* \n(the only film in which he appears with Nancy Reagan), and his one turn at playing a vicious villain,\nin the 1964 remake *The Killers* with Lee Marvin and Angie Dickenson. Throughout his film career,\nReagan's mother answered much of his fan mail.\n",

His first assignment was\nat the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation\nOffice. Upon the approval of the U.S. Army Air\nForces, he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned\nto AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the 18th AAF Base\nUnit at Culver City, California. On January 14, 1943, he was promoted to first\nlieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of *This Is the Army* at Burbank,\nCalifornia. He returned to the 18th AAF Base Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to\ncaptain on July 22, 1943.\n\nIn January 1944, Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City\nto participate in the opening of the Sixth War Loan Drive, which campaigned for the purchase of\nwar bonds. He was reassigned to the 18th AAF Base\nUnit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of World War\nII. By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the Air Force, including cockpit\nsimulations for B-29 crews scheduled to bomb Japan. He was separated\nfrom active duty on December 9, 1945, as an Army captain. While he\nwas in the service, Reagan obtained a film reel depicting the liberation\nof the Auschwitz concentration camp; he held on to it,\nbelieving that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred.\n",

After World War II, he resumed service and became\nthird vice president in 1946. When the SAG president and six board\nmembers resigned in March 1947 due to the union's new bylaws on\nconflict of interest, Reagan was\nelected president in a special election. He was subsequently re-elected\nsix times, in 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1959. He led the SAG\nthrough implementing the 1947 Taft--Hartley\nAct, various labor-management disputes,\nand the Hollywood blacklist era.\nFirst instituted in 1947 by Studio executives who agreed that they would\nnot employ anyone believed to be or to have been\nCommunists or sympathetic with radical\npolitics, the blacklist grew steadily\nlarger during the early 1950s as the U.S. Congress continued to\ninvestigate domestic political subversion.\n\nAlso during his tenure, Reagan was instrumental in securing\nresiduals for television\nactors when their episodes were re-run, and later, for motion picture\nactors when their studio films aired on TV.\n",

    "text": "### HUAC's Hollywood hearings \n\nIn October 1947 during HUAC's Hollywood hearings, Reagan testified as\npresident of the Screen Actors\nGuild:\n\n    There has been a small group within the Screen Actors Guild which has\n    consistently opposed the policy of the guild board and officers of the\n    guild... suspected of more or less following the tactics that we\n    associate with the Communist Party... At times they have attempted to\n    be a disruptive influence... I have heard different discussions and\n    some of them tagged as Communists... I found myself misled into being\n    a sponsor on another occasion for a function that was held under the\n    auspices of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee\n    Committee.\n\nRegarding a \"jurisdictional strike\" going on for seven months at that\ntime, Reagan testified:\n\n    The first time that this word \"Communist\" was ever injected into any\n    of the meetings concerning the strike was at a meeting in Chicago with\n    Mr. William Hutchinson, president of the United Brotherhood of\n    Carpenters and\n    Joiners, who\n    were on strike at the time. He asked the Screen Actors Guild to submit\n    terms to Mr. Walsh, for Walsh to give in the settling of this strike,\n    and he told us to tell Mr. Walsh that if he would give in on these\n    terms he in turn would run this Sorrell and the other Commies out---I\n    am quoting him---and break it up.\n\nHowever, Reagan also opposed measures soon to manifest in the\nMundt--Nixon Bill in May 1948 by opining:\n\n    As a citizen I would hesitate, or not like, to see any political party\n    outlawed on the basis of its political ideology... I detest, I abhor\n    their philosophy, but I detest more than that their tactics, which are\n    those of the fifth column, and are dishonest, but at the same time I\n    never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either\n    fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of\n    our democratic principles through that fear or resentment.\n\nFurther, when asked whether he was aware of Communist efforts within the\nScreen Writers Guild, Reagan would\nnot play along, saying, \"Sir, like the other gentlemen, I must say that\nthat is hearsay.\"\n",

He was hired as the host of *General Electric Theater*, a series of weekly\ndramas that became very popular. His contract required him to tour\nGeneral Electric plants 16 weeks out of the year, which often demanded that he give 14 talks per day.\nHe earned approximately $125,000 (equivalent to $1.1 million in 2020) in this role. The show ran for ten\nseasons from 1953 to 1962, which increased Reagan's national\nprofile. On January 1, 1959, Reagan was the host and announcer for\nABC's coverage of the Tournament of Roses Parade. In his final work\nas a professional actor, Reagan was a host and performer from 1964 to\n1965 on the television series *Death Valley Days*.\nFollowing their marriage in 1952, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who continued to use the stage\nname, acted together in three TV series episodes, including a 1958 installment\nof *General Electric Theater* titled \"A Turkey for the President\".\n",

    "text": "## Marriages and children \n\nIn 1938, Reagan co-starred in the film *Brother Rat* with actress Jane\nWyman. They announced their engagement at the Chicago Theatre and\nmarried on January 26, 1940, at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather\nchurch in Glendale, California. Together\nthey had two biological daughters, Maureen\n(1941--2001) and Christine (born prematurely, and died, June 26, 1947);\nand adopted a son, Michael.\nAfter the couple had arguments about Reagan's political ambitions,\nWyman filed for divorce in 1948, citing a distraction due to her\nhusband's Screen Actors Guild union duties; the divorce was finalized\nin 1949. Wyman, who was a registered\nRepublican, also stated that their breakup stemmed from a difference in politics (Reagan was\nstill a Democrat at the time). When Reagan became president 32 years later, he became the\nfirst divorced person to assume the nation's highest office.\nReagan and Wyman continued to be friends until his death; Wyman voted\nfor Reagan in both his runs, and on his death she said, \"America has\nlost a great president and a great, kind, and gentle man.\"\n\nReagan met actress Nancy Davis\n(1921--2016) in 1949 after she contacted him in his capacity\nas president of the Screen Actors Guild. He helped her with issues\nregarding her name appearing on a Communist blacklist in Hollywood; she\nhad been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. She described their meeting\nby saying, \"I don't know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it\nwas pretty close.\" They were engaged at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles and were\nmarried on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the Valley\n(North Hollywood, now Studio City) San Fernando Valley. Actor William Holden served as best man at the ceremony.\nThey had two children: Patti and Ronald \"Ron\".\n\nThe couple's relationship was close, authentic and intimate.\nDuring his presidency, they often displayed affection for each other;\none press secretary said, \"They never took each other for granted. They\nnever stopped courting.\" He often called her \"Mommy\", and\nshe called him \"Ronnie\". He once wrote to her, \"Whatever I\ntreasure and enjoy... all would be without\nmeaning if I didn't have you.\" In 1998, while he was stricken by\nAlzheimer's, Nancy told *Vanity Fair*, \"Our relationship is very\nspecial. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life\nbegan with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life\nwithout him.\" Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016, at the age of 94.\n",

    "text": "## Early political career \n\nReagan began as a Hollywood Democrat,\nand Franklin D. Roosevelt was \"a true hero\" to him. He moved to the\nright-wing in the 1950s, became a Republican in 1962, and emerged as a leading conservative spokesman in\nthe Goldwater campaign of 1964.\n\nIn his early political career, he joined numerous political committees\nwith a left-wing orientation, such as the American Veterans Committee.\nHe fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and\nsupported Helen Gahagan Douglas in 1950 when she was defeated for the\nSenate by Richard Nixon. It was his belief that\nCommunists were a powerful backstage influence\nin those groups that led him to rally his friends against them.\n\nAt rallies, Reagan frequently spoke with a strong ideological dimension.\nIn December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in\nHollywood by pressure from the Warner Bros.\nstudio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his\npresidency when he specifically stated his opposition to mutual assured\ndestruction. Reagan also built on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. In the\n1948 presidential election, Reagan strongly supported Harry S. Truman and\nappeared on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles.\nIn the early 1950s, his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew,\nand he shifted to the right when he endorsed the presidential\ncandidacies of Dwight D. Eisenhower\n(1952 and 1956) and Richard Nixon (1960).\n\nReagan was hired by General Electric in 1954 to host the *General Electric Theater*,\na weekly TV drama series. He also traveled across the country to give motivational\nspeeches to over 200,000 GE employees. His many speeches---which he\nwrote himself---were non-partisan but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by\nLemuel Boulware, a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative\nstrategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern\nAmerican conservatism: free markets, anticommunism, lower taxes, and limited\ngovernment. Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally\nregistered as a Republican. He often said, \"I didn't leave the\nDemocratic Party. The party left me.\"\n\nWhen the legislation that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961,\nhe created a recording for the American Medical Association warning that\nsuch legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said\nthat if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, \"we will\nawake to find that we have socialism. And if you\ndon't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are\ngoing to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our\nchildren's children, what it once was like in America when men were\nfree.\" Other Democratic initiatives he opposed in the 1960s\nincluded the Food Stamp Program, raising the minimum wage, and the establishment of the Peace\nCorps. He also joined the National Rifle\nAssociation and would become a lifetime member.\n\nReagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative\npresidential contender Barry Goldwater in\n1964. Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the\nimportance of smaller government. He consolidated themes that he had\ndeveloped in his talks for GE to deliver his famous speech, \"A Time\nfor Choosing\":\n\n\nThis \"A Time for Choosing\" speech was not enough to turn around the\nfaltering Goldwater campaign, but it was the crucial event that\nestablished Reagan's national political visibility. David\nBroder of *The Washington Post* called it,\n\"the most successful national political debut since William Jennings\nBryan electrified the 1896 Democratic convention with his Cross of Gold\nspeech\".\n",

    "name": "Governor of California (1967--1975)",
    "text": "## Governor of California (1967--1975) \n\n\nCalifornia Republicans were impressed with Reagan's political views and\ncharisma after his \"Time for Choosing\" speech, and in late 1965\nhe announced his campaign for governor in the 1966\nelection. He defeated former San Francisco mayor George\nChristopher in the Republican primary.\nIn Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: \"to send the\nwelfare bums back to work\", and, in reference to\nburgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student\nprotests at the University of California, Berkeley,\n\"to clean up the mess at Berkeley\". In 1966, Reagan accomplished\nwhat both U.S. senator William Knowland\nin 1958 and former vice president Richard\nNixon in 1962 failed to do: he was elected,\ndefeating Pat Brown, the Democratic two-term\ngovernor. Reagan was sworn in on January 2, 1967. In his first term, he\nfroze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the\nbudget.\n\nShortly after assuming office, Reagan tested the 1968 presidential\nwaters as part of a \"Stop Nixon\" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's southern\nsupport and become a compromise candidate if neither Nixon nor second-place candidate Nelson\nRockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the Republican\nconvention. However, by the time of the convention, Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than\nhe needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.\n\nReagan was involved in several high-profile conflicts with the protest\nmovements of the era, including his public criticism of university\nadministrators for tolerating student demonstrations at the Berkeley\ncampus. On May 15, 1969, during the People's Park protests\nat the university's campus (the original purpose of which was to\ndiscuss the Arab--Israeli conflict, Reagan sent the\nCalifornia Highway Patrol and other officers to quell the protests. This led to an incident that\nbecame known as \"Bloody Thursday\", resulting in the death of student\nJames Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.\nIn addition, 111 police officers were injured in the conflict, including\none who was knifed in the chest. Reagan then called out 2,200 state\nNational Guard troops to occupy\nthe city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the\nprotesters. The Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in\nPeople's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the university removed\ncordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park\non hold. One year after the incident, Reagan responded to\nquestions about campus protest movements saying, \"If it takes a\nbloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement.\" When\nthe Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Patty Hearst in Berkeley and\ndemanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked to a group\nof political aides about a botulism outbreak\ncontaminating the food.\n\nEarly in 1967, the national debate on abortion was starting to gain\ntraction. In the early stages of the debate, Democratic California state\nsenator Anthony Beilenson introduced the\nTherapeutic Abortion Act in an effort to reduce the number of\n\"back-room abortions\" performed in California. The state\nlegislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of\nindecision, he reluctantly signed it on June 14, 1967. About two\nmillion abortions would be performed as a result, mostly because of a\nprovision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the\nmother. Reagan had been in office for only four months when he\nsigned the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as\ngovernor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he\ncalled the \"consequences\" of the bill, he announced that he was\nanti-abortion. He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.\n\nIn 1967, Reagan signed the Mulford Act, which repealed a law allowing the public\ncarrying of loaded firearms (becoming California Penal Code\n12031 and 171(c)). The bill, which was named after Republican\nassemblyman Don Mulford, garnered national\nattention after the Black Panthers marched\nbearing arms upon the California State\nCapitol to protest it.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful attempt to force a recall election on Reagan in\n1968, he was re-elected governor in 1970, defeating\nJesse M. Unruh. He chose not to seek a\nthird term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest\nfrustrations in office was the controversy of capital\npunishment, which he strongly\nsupported. His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area\nwere thwarted when the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia issued its *People v. Anderson* decision, which invalidated\nall death sentences issued in California before 1972, though the\ndecision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only\nexecution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when\nAaron Mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state in San Quentin's gas chamber.\n\nIn 1969, Reagan signed the Family Law Act, which was an amalgam of two\nbills that had been written and revised by the California State\nLegislature over more than two years. It became the first no-fault\ndivorce legislation in the United States. Years later, he told his son Michael that\nsigning that law was his \"greatest regret\" in public life.\n\nReagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue\nin his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform\nof sending \"the welfare bums back to work\", he spoke out against the\nidea of the welfare state. He also strongly\nadvocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the\neconomy, including that of undue federal taxation.\n",

    "text": "## 1976 presidential campaign \n\nReagan's 1976 campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager\nJohn Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely\nnomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the\nstrategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and\nhis native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to\nReagan when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with\nfour more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that\nvictory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest\nAngelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart, whom Reagan as president would appoint in 1981 as director of the\nFederal Highway Administration.\n\nHowever, as the GOP convention neared, Ford\nappeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing,\nReagan chose moderate senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running\nmate if nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.\n\nReagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and\nthe threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he\nreceived 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an\nindependent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a\nfaithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington.\n",

    "text": "## 1980 presidential campaign \n\nThe 1980 presidential election featured Reagan against incumbent\npresident Jimmy Carter and was conducted amid a multitude of domestic\nconcerns as well as the ongoing Iran hostage\ncrisis. Reagan's campaign stressed\nsome of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to stimulate the\neconomy, less government interference in people's lives,\nstates' rights, and a strong\nnational defense. Ronald Reagan,\nmoderator Jon Breen, and Bush participate in the Nashua, New Hampshire\npresidential debate, 1980 Reagan launched his campaign with an indictment of a federal government that he\nbelieved had \"overspent, overstimulated, and overregulated\". After\nreceiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his\nopponents from the primaries, George H. W. Bush, to be his running mate. His relaxed\nand confident appearance during the televised Reagan--Carter debate on October 28\nboosted his popularity and helped to widen his lead in the polls.\n\nOn November 4, Reagan won a decisive victory over Carter, carrying 44\nstates and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49 in six states\nplus D.C. He also won the popular vote, receiving 50.7 percent to\nCarter's 41.0 percent, with independent John B.\nAnderson garnering 6.6 percent. Republicans also won a majority of seats in the\nSenate for the first time since 1952, though Democrats retained a majority in the House of\nRepresentatives.\n",

    "text": "#### Prayer in schools and a moment of silence \n\nReagan campaigned vigorously to restore organized prayer to the schools,\nfirst as a moment of prayer and later as a moment of silence. In\n1981, Reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional\namendment on school\nprayer. Reagan's\nelection reflected an opposition to the 1962 Supreme Court case\n*Engel v. Vitale* that had prohibited\nstate officials from composing an official state prayer and requiring\nthat it be recited in the public schools. Reagan's 1981 proposed\namendment stated: \"Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to\nprohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public\ninstitutions. No person shall be required by the United States or by any\nstate to participate in prayer.\" In 1984, Reagan again raised the\nissue, asking Congress, \"why can't the freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every\nschoolroom across this land?\" In 1985, Reagan expressed his\ndisappointment that the Supreme Court ruling still banned a moment of\nsilence for public schools, and said that efforts to reinstitute prayer\nin public schools were \"an uphill battle\". In 1987, Reagan\nrenewed his call for Congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and\nend \"the expulsion of God from America's classrooms\".\n",

    "text": "#### Air traffic controllers' strike \n\nIn August 1981, PATCO, the union of federal air traffic controllers, went on\nstrike, violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from\nstriking. Declaring the situation an emergency as described in the\n1947 Taft--Hartley Act, Reagan stated\nthat if the air traffic controllers \"do not report for work within 48\nhours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated\".\nThey did not return, and on August 5, Reagan fired 11,345 striking air\ntraffic controllers who had ignored his order and used supervisors and\nmilitary controllers to handle the nation's commercial air traffic\nuntil new controllers could be hired and trained. A leading\nreference work on public administration concluded, \"The firing of PATCO\nemployees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take\ncontrol of the bureaucracy, but it also sent a clear message to the\nprivate sector that unions no longer needed to be feared.\"\n\n#### \"Reaganomics\" and the economy \n\n\nDuring Jimmy Carter's last full year in office (1980), inflation\naveraged 12.5 percent, compared with 4.4 percent during Reagan's last\nfull year in office (1988). During Reagan's administration, the\nunemployment rate declined from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent, with the\nrate reaching highs of 10.8 percent in 1982 and 10.4 percent in 1983,\naveraging 7.5 percent over the eight years, and real GDP growth averaged\n3.4 percent with a high of 8.6 percent in 1983, while nominal GDP growth\naveraged 7.4 percent, and peaked at 12.2 percent in 1982.\n\nReagan implemented neoliberal policies based\non supply-side economics, advocating\na *laissez-faire* philosophy and\nfree-market fiscal policy,\nseeking to stimulate the economy with large, across-the-board tax\ncuts. He also supported returning the\nUnited States to some sort of gold standard\nand successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to\nstudy how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories of\nArthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed\ntax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax\nbase, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a\ntheory that entered political discussion as the Laffer\ncurve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate\nwith supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic\nindicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large\nincreases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His\npolicy of \"peace through strength\" resulted in a record\npeacetime defense buildup including a 40 percent real increase in\ndefense spending between 1981 and 1985.\n\nDuring Reagan's presidency, federal income tax\nrates were lowered\nsignificantly with the signing of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered\nthe top marginal tax bracket from 70 percent to 50 percent over three\nyears (as part of a \"5--10--10\" plan), and the lowest bracket\nfrom 14 percent to 11 percent. Other tax increases passed by Congress\nand signed by Reagan ensured, however, that tax revenues over his two\nterms were 18.2 percent of GDP as compared to 18.1 percent over the 40\nyears of 1970--2010. The 1981 tax act also required that\nexemptions and brackets be indexed for inflation starting in 1985.\n\nConversely, Congress passed and Reagan signed into law tax increases of\nsome nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such\ngovernment programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of\n1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.\nTEFRA was the \"largest peacetime tax increase in American\nhistory\". Gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s\nrecession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of 7.9 percent per\nyear, with a high of 12.2 percent growth in 1981. Unemployment\npeaked at 10.8 percent monthly rate in December 1982---higher than any\ntime since the Great Depression---then dropped during the rest of\nReagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while\ninflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of\n1986, another bipartisan effort\nchampioned by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of\ntax brackets to four and slashing several tax breaks. The top rate was\ndropped to 28 percent, but capital gains taxes were increased on those\nwith the highest incomes from 20 percent to 28 percent. The increase of\nthe lowest tax bracket from 11 percent to 15 percent was more than\noffset by the expansion of personal exemption, standard\ndeduction, and earned income tax credit.\nThe net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a\nreduction of income tax liability at all income levels.\n\nThe net effect of all Reagan-era tax bills was a 1 percent decrease in\ngovernment revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue\nestimates from the administration's first post-enactment January\nbudgets. However, federal income tax receipts increased from 1980\nto 1989, rising from $308.7\u00a0billion to $549\u00a0billion or an\naverage annual rate of 8.2 percent (2.5 percent attributed to higher\nSocial Security receipts), and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 7.1 percent.\n\nReagan's policies proposed that economic growth would occur when\nmarginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment, which would then\nlead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this\n\"trickle-down economics\"---the\nbelief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a\n\"trickle-down\" effect reaching the poor. Questions arose whether\nReagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in\npoverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as\nindifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated by\nthe fact that Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum\nwage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments \nby 60 percent, cutting the budget for public\nhousing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and\neliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block\nGrant program. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned\nincome, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20 percent.\nReagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the\nrates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out\nat 28 percent. Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising\ntaxes eleven times throughout his presidency, all in the name of fiscal\nresponsibility. According to Paul Krugman, \"Over all, the 1982 tax increase\nundid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was\nsubstantially larger than Mr.\u00a0Clinton's 1993 tax\nincrease.\" According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce\nBartlett, Reagan's tax increases throughout his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.\n\nReagan was opposed to government intervention, and he cut the budgets of\nnon-military programs including Medicaid, food stamps, federal education programs and the\nEPA. He protected entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, but his\nadministration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the\nSocial Security disability rolls.\n\nThe administration's stance toward the savings and\nloan industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis.\nA minority of the critics of Reaganomics also suggested that the policies\npartially influenced the stock market crash of\n1987, but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash. To cover newly\nspawned federal budget deficits, the United States borrowed heavily both\ndomestically and abroad, raising the national\ndebt from $997\u00a0billion to $2.85\u00a0trillion. Reagan described the new debt as the \"greatest\ndisappointment\" of his presidency.\n\nHe reappointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and in 1987 he appointed monetarist Alan Greenspan\nto succeed him. Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil that had\ncontributed to the energy crises of 1973--1974 and the summer of\n1979. The price of oil subsequently dropped, and there were\nno fuel shortages like those in the 1970s. Reagan also fulfilled a\n1980 campaign promise to repeal the windfall profits\ntax in 1988, which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil. Some economists, such as\nNobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell, argue that Reagan's tax\npolicies invigorated America's economy and contributed to the economic\nboom of the 1990s. Other economists, such as Nobel Prize winner\nRobert Solow, argue that Reagan's deficits were a major reason his successor, George H. W. Bush, reneged on his\ncampaign promise and resorted to raising taxes.\n\nDuring Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the United\nStates Intelligence Community to ensure America's economic strength. The program, Project Socrates,\ndeveloped and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next\nevolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a\ncompetitive advantage---automated innovation. To ensure that the United\nStates acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan,\nduring his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new\nfederal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide\nbasis. However, Reagan's term came to an end before the executive order\ncould be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration,\nlabeling Project Socrates as \"industrial policy\", had it terminated.\n",

In 1982, he signed a bill extending the Voting Rights\nAct for 25 years after a grass-roots lobbying and legislative campaign forced him to abandon his\nplan to ease that law's restrictions. He also signed legislation\nestablishing a federal Martin Luther King holiday, though he did so with\nreservations. In March 1988, he vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, but his veto was\noverridden by Congress. Reagan had argued that the legislation infringed\non states' rights and the rights of churches and business owners.\n",

    "text": "#### Escalation of the Cold War \n\nReagan escalated the Cold War, accelerating a reversal from the policy of d\u00e9tente that began\nduring the Carter administration, following the Afghan Saur Revolution and subsequent Soviet invasion.\nHe ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces\nand implemented new policies that were directed towards the Soviet Union;\nhe revived the B-1 Lancer program that had been canceled by\nthe Carter administration, and he produced the MX missile. In response to Soviet deployment\nof the SS-20, Reagan oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing missile in West Germany.\nIn 1982 Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding\nits proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy, but\nit also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on\nthat revenue. Reagan retreated on this issue.\n\nIn 1984, journalist Nicholas Lemann\ninterviewed Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and summarized the strategy of\nthe Reagan administration to roll back the Soviet Union:\n\nLemann noted that when he wrote that in 1984, he thought the Reaganites\nwere living in a fantasy world. But by 2016, Lemann stated that the\npassage represents \"a fairly uncontroversial description of what Reagan\nactually did\".\n\nReagan and the United Kingdom's prime minister Margaret\nThatcher both denounced the Soviet Union\nin ideological terms. In a famous address on June 8, 1982, to the\nParliament of the United Kingdom in the Royal\nGallery of the Palace of Westminster, Reagan said, \"the march\nof freedom and democracy will leave\nMarxism--Leninism on the ash heap of history.\" On March 3, 1983, he predicted that communism would collapse, stating,\n\"Communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last\npages even now are being written.\" In a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8, 1983,\nReagan called the Soviet Union \"an evil empire\".\n\nAfter Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 near Moneron\nIsland on September 1, 1983, carrying 269\npeople, including Georgia congressman Larry McDonald, Reagan labeled the act a\n\"massacre\" and declared that the Soviets had turned \"against the\nworld and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people\neverywhere\". The Reagan administration responded to the incident\nby suspending all Soviet passenger air service to the United States and\ndropped several agreements being negotiated with the Soviets, wounding\nthem financially. As a result of the shootdown, and the cause of\nKAL 007's going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its\nnavigational system, Reagan announced on September 16, 1983, that the\nGlobal Positioning System would\nbe made available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in\norder to avert similar navigational errors in the future.\n\nUnder a policy that came to be known as the Reagan\nDoctrine, Reagan and his administration\nalso provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist resistance\nmovements in an effort to \"rollback\" Soviet-backed communist governments\nin Africa, Asia, and Latin America. However, in a break from the\nCarter administration's policy of arming Taiwan under the Taiwan\nRelations Act, Reagan also agreed with\nthe communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan.\n\nReagan deployed the CIA's Special Activities\nDivision to Afghanistan and\nPakistan. They were instrumental in training, equipping and leading\nMujahideen forces against the Soviet Army. President\nReagan's Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in\nending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, though some of the\nUnited States funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat\nto U.S. troops in the 2001 War in Afghanistan. The\nCIA also began sharing information with the Iranian\ngovernment which it was secretly courting.\nIn one instance, in 1982, this practice enabled the government to\nidentify and purge communists from its\nministries and to virtually eliminate the pro-Soviet infrastructure in Iran.\n\nIn March 1983, Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense\nInitiative, a defense project that would have used ground- and space-based systems to\nprotect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic\nmissiles. Reagan believed that this defense shield could make\nnuclear war impossible. There was much disbelief surrounding\nthe program's scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub SDI\n\"Star Wars\" and argue that its technological objective was\nunattainable. The Soviets became concerned about the possible\neffects SDI would have; leader Yuri Andropov said it would put \"the entire world in jeopardy\".\nFor those reasons, David Gergen, a former aide to President Reagan,\nbelieves that in retrospect, SDI hastened the end of the Cold War.\n\nThough supported by leading American\nconservatives who argued that Reagan's foreign policy strategy was essential to protecting U.S.\nsecurity interests, critics labeled the administration's foreign policy\ninitiatives as aggressive and imperialistic, and chided them as\n\"warmongering\". The administration was also heavily criticized\nfor backing anti-communist leaders accused of severe human rights violations,\nsuch as Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 of Chad and Efra\u00edn R\u00edos\nMontt of Guatemala. During the 16 months (1982--1983) Montt was President of Guatemala,\nthe Guatemalan military was accused of genocide for massacres of members of\nthe Ixil people and other indigenous groups. Reagan had said that Montt was getting a \"bum rap\", and\ndescribed him as \"a man of great personal integrity\". Previous\nhuman rights violations had prompted the United States to cut off aid to\nthe Guatemalan government, but the Reagan administration appealed to\nCongress to restart military aid. Although unsuccessful with that, the\nadministration was successful in providing nonmilitary assistance such\nas USAID.\n",

    "text": "#### 1984 presidential campaign\n\nReagan accepted the Republican nomination in the Republican\nconvention in Dallas, Texas. He proclaimed that it was \"morning again in America\",\nregarding the recovering\neconomy and the dominating performance by the American athletes at the\n1984 Summer Olympics on home soil, among other things. He became the first U.S. president to\nopen an Olympic Games. Previous Olympics taking place in the United States\nhad been opened by either the vice president (three times) or another\nperson in charge (twice).\n\nReagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former vice\npresident Walter Mondale. Following a weak\nperformance in the first presidential debate, Reagan's ability to win\nanother term was questioned. Reagan rebounded in the second\ndebate; confronting questions about his age, he quipped: \"I will not\nmake age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for\npolitical purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience\". This remark\ngenerated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.\n\nThat November, Reagan won a landslide re-election victory, carrying 49\nof the 50 states. Mondale won only his home state of Minnesota and the\nDistrict of Columbia. Reagan won 525 of the 538 electoral votes,\nthe most of any presidential candidate in U.S. history. In terms\nof electoral votes, this was the second-most-lopsided presidential\nelection in modern U.S. history; Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936\nvictory over Alf Landon, in which he won 98.5 percent or 523 of\nthe then-total 531 electoral votes, ranks first. Reagan won 58.8\npercent of the popular vote to Mondale's 40.6 percent. His popular vote\nmargin of victory---nearly 16.9\u00a0million votes (54.4\u00a0million for Reagan\nto 37.5\u00a0million for Mondale)---was exceeded only by Richard\nNixon in his 1972 victory over George McGovern.\n",

    "text": "#### War on drugs \n\nIn response to concerns about the increasing crack\nepidemic, Reagan began the war on drugs\ncampaign in 1982, a policy led by the federal government to reduce the\nillegal drug trade. Though Nixon had previously declared war on drugs,\nReagan advocated more aggressive policies. He said that \"drugs\nwere menacing our society\" and promised to fight for drug-free schools\nand workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and\ndrug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.\n\nIn 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted\n$1.7\u00a0billion (equivalent to\n$4 billion in 2020) to fund the war on drugs and\nspecified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses. The bill\nwas criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the\nprison population, and\ncritics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the\navailability of drugs on the street while resulting in a tremendous\nfinancial burden for America. Defenders of the effort point to\nsuccess in reducing rates of adolescent drug use which they attribute to\nthe Reagan administrations policies: marijuana use among\nhigh-school seniors declined from 33 percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 1991.\nFirst Lady Nancy Reagan made the war on drugs her main\npriority by founding the \"Just Say No\" drug\nawareness campaign, which aimed to discourage children and teenagers\nfrom engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of\nsaying \"no\". Nancy Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising\nawareness about the dangers of drugs, including alcohol.\n",

    "text": "#### Response to AIDS epidemic \n\nAccording to AIDS activist organizations such as ACT UP and scholars such as Don Francis and Peter S. Arno,\nthe Reagan administration largely ignored the AIDS\ncrisis, which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, the same year Reagan took\noffice. They also claim that AIDS research was\nchronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests\nfor more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease\nControl were routinely denied.\n\nBy the time President Reagan gave his first prepared speech on the\nepidemic, six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been\ndiagnosed with AIDS, and 20,849 had died of it. By 1989, the year\nReagan left office, more than 100,000 people had been diagnosed with\nAIDS in the United States, and more than 59,000 of them had died of it.\n\nReagan administration officials countered criticisms of neglect by\nnoting that federal funding for AIDS-related programs rose over his\npresidency, from a few hundred thousand dollars in 1982 to $2.3\u00a0billion\nin 1989. In a September 1985 press conference, Reagan said: \"this\nis a top priority with us...there's no question about the seriousness\nof this and the need to find an answer.\" Gary\nBauer, Reagan's domestic policy adviser near\nthe end of his second term, argued that Reagan's belief in cabinet\ngovernment led him to assign the job of\nspeaking out against AIDS to his Surgeon General of the United\nStates and the United\nStates Secretary of Health and Human\nServices.\n",

    "text": "#### Addressing apartheid \n\nFrom the late 1960s onward, the American public grew increasingly vocal\nin its opposition to the apartheid policy of the\nwhite-minority government of South\nAfrica, and in its insistence that the U.S.\nimpose economic and diplomatic sanctions on South Africa. The\nstrength of the anti-apartheid opposition surged during Reagan's first\nterm in office as its component disinvestment from South\nAfrica movement, which had\nbeen in existence for quite some years, gained critical mass following\nin the United States, particularly on college campuses and among\nmainline Protestant denominations. President Reagan was opposed to divestiture because, as he wrote in a letter to\nSammy Davis Jr., it \"would hurt the very\npeople we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within South\nAfrica to try and bring influence to bear on the government\". He also\nnoted the fact that the \"American-owned industries there employ more\nthan 80,000 blacks\" and that their employment practices were \"very\ndifferent from the normal South African customs\".\n\nAs an alternative strategy for opposing apartheid, the Reagan\nAdministration developed a policy of constructive\nengagement with the South African\ngovernment as a means of encouraging it to move away from apartheid\ngradually. It was part of a larger initiative designed to foster\npeaceful economic development and political change throughout southern Africa. This policy, however,\nengendered much public criticism and renewed calls for the imposition of\nstringent sanctions. In response, Reagan announced the imposition\nof new sanctions on the South African government, including an arms\nembargo in late 1985. These sanctions\nwere, however, seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists, and as\ninsufficient by the president's opponents in Congress.\nIn August 1986, Congress approved the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which included\ntougher sanctions. Reagan vetoed the act, but the veto was overridden by\nCongress. Afterward, Reagan reiterated that his administration and \"all\nAmerica\" opposed apartheid, and said, \"the\ndebate... was not whether or not to oppose\napartheid but, instead, how best to oppose it and how best to bring\nfreedom to that troubled country.\" Several European countries as well\nas Japan soon followed the U.S. lead and imposed their sanctions on\nSouth Africa.\n",

    "text": "#### Libya bombing \n\nRelations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan\nwere continually contentious, beginning with the Gulf of Sidra\nincident in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was\nconsidered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev and Cuban leader Fidel\nCastro, part of a group known as the \"unholy trinity\" and was also labeled as \"our international public enemy\nnumber one\" by a CIA official. These tensions were later revived\nin early April 1986, when a bomb exploded in a Berlin\ndiscoth\u00e8que, resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one\nserviceman. Stating that there was \"irrefutable proof\" that Libya had\ndirected the \"terrorist bombing\", Reagan authorized the use of force\nagainst the country. In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the United\nStates launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\nallowed the U.S. Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the\nattack, on the justification that the UK was supporting America's right\nto self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations\nCharter. The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi's \"ability to export terrorism\", offering\nhim \"incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior\". The\npresident addressed the nation from the Oval\nOffice after the attacks had commenced,\nstating, \"When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the\nworld on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long\nas I'm in this office.\" The attack was condemned by many\ncountries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions,\nthe United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution\n41/38 which \"condemns the military attack perpetrated against the\nSocialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which\nconstitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of\ninternational law\".\n",

Upon signing the act at a ceremony\nheld beside the newly refurbished Statue of\nLiberty, Reagan said, \"The legalization\nprovisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of\nindividuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of\nthe benefits of a free and open society. Very soon, many of these men\nand women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if\nthey choose, they may become Americans.\" Reagan also said, \"The\nemployer sanctions program is the keystone and major element. It will\nremove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job\nopportunities which draw illegal aliens here.\"\n",

    "text": "#### Iran--Contra affair \n\nIn 1986, the Iran--Contra affair became a problem for the administration\nstemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during\nthe Iran--Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in\nNicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political\nscandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of\nJustice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that\nthe United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.\nReagan later withdrew the agreement between the United States and the International Court of Justice.\n\nPresident Reagan professed that he was unaware of the plot's existence.\nHe opened his own investigation and appointed two Republicans and one\nDemocrat, John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, respectively, to investigate the\nscandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had\nprior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his\ndisengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds\npossible. A separate report by Congress concluded that \"If the\npresident did not know what his national security advisers were doing,\nhe should have.\" Reagan's popularity declined from 67 percent to\n46 percent in less than a week, the most significant and quickest\ndecline ever for a president. The scandal resulted in eleven\nconvictions and fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff.\n\nMany Central Americans criticize Reagan for his support of the Contras,\ncalling him an anti-communist zealot, blinded to human rights abuses,\nwhile others say he \"saved Central America\". Daniel Ortega, Sandinistan and\npresident of Nicaragua, said that he hoped God would forgive Reagan for his \"dirty war against Nicaragua\".\n\nIn 1988, near the end of the Iran--Iraq War, the U.S. Navy\nguided-missile cruiser USS Vincennes\naccidentally shot down Iran Air Flight\n655 killing 290 civilian passengers.\nThe incident further worsened already tense Iran--United States\nrelations.\n",

    "text": "#### Decline of the Soviet Union and thaw in relations \n\nUntil the early 1980s, the United States had relied on the qualitative\nsuperiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the\ngap had been narrowed. Although the Soviet Union did not\naccelerate military spending after President Reagan's military\nbuildup, their enormous military expenses, in combination with\ncollectivized agriculture and\ninefficient planned manufacturing, were a\nheavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, oil\nprices in 1985 fell to one third of the previous level; oil was the\nprimary source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a\nstagnant Soviet economy during Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure.\n\nMeanwhile, Reagan escalated the rhetoric. In his famous 1983 speech to\nreligious fundamentalists, he outlined his strategy for victory. First,\nhe labeled the Soviet system an \"Evil\nEmpire\" and a failure---its demise\nwould be a godsend for the world. Second, Reagan explained his strategy\nwas an arms buildup that would leave the Soviets far behind, with no\nchoice but to negotiate arms reduction. Finally, displaying his\ncharacteristic optimism, he praised liberal democracy and promised that\nsuch a system eventually would triumph over Soviet communism.\n\nReagan appreciated the revolutionary change in the direction of the\nSoviet policy with Mikhail Gorbachev, and shifted to diplomacy, intending to encourage the Soviet leader to\npursue substantial arms agreements. He and Gorbachev held four summit conferences\nbetween 1985 and 1988: the first in Geneva, Switzerland,\nthe second in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, the third in Washington, D.C.,\nand the fourth in Moscow. Reagan believed that if he could\npersuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this\nwould lead to reform and the end of Communism. The critical summit\nwas at Reykjav\u00edk in October 1986, where they met alone, with translators\nbut with no aides. To the astonishment of the world, and the chagrin of\nReagan's most conservative supporters, they agreed to abolish all\nnuclear weapons. Gorbachev then asked the end of SDI. Reagan said no,\nclaiming that it was defensive only, and that he would share the secrets\nwith the Soviets. No deal was achieved. !Reagan (*right*) with\nMauno Koivisto, the President of\nFinland, in Helsinki, 1988\n\nSpeaking at the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987,\nfive years after his first visit to West Berlin as president,\nReagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying \"General Secretary Gorbachev, if you\nseek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern\nEurope, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate! Mr.\nGorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this\nwall!\"  Later, in November 1989, East German authorities began allowing citizens to pass freely\nthrough border checkpoints, and began dismantling the Wall\nthe following June; its demolition was completed in 1992.\n\nAt Gorbachev's visit to Washington in December 1987, he and Reagan\nsigned the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces\nTreaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear\nweapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms\nReduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that\nthe name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks\nto Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.\n\nWhen Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed\nas a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he\nstill considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. \"No,\" he replied,\n\"I was talking about another time, another era.\" At Gorbachev's\nrequest, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the Moscow State\nUniversity.\n",

His\ndecision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small,\naudio-amplifying device boosted their sales.\n\nOn July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery at Bethesda Naval\nHospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. He relinquished presidential power\nto the vice president for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined\nin the 25th Amendment, which he\nspecifically avoided invoking. The surgery lasted just under three\nhours and was successful. Reagan resumed the powers of the\npresidency later that day. In August of that year, he underwent an\noperation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose. In October,\nmore skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.\n\nIn January 1987, Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged\nprostate that caused further worries about his\nhealth. No cancerous growths were found, and he was not sedated during\nthe operation. In July of that year, aged 76, he underwent a third\nskin cancer operation on his nose.\n\nOn January 7, 1989, Reagan underwent surgery at Walter Reed Army\nMedical Center to repair a Dupuytren's contracture of the\nring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted for more than three\nhours and was performed under regional anesthesia.\n",

    "text": "### Judiciary\n\nDuring the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan pledged that he would\nappoint the first female Supreme Court Justice if given the\nopportunity. That opportunity came during his first year in office\nwhen Associate Justice Potter Stewart retired; Reagan selected\nSandra Day O'Connor, who was confirmed\nunanimously by the Senate. In his second term, Reagan had three\nopportunities to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. When Chief Justice Warren E. Burger retired in September 1986, Reagan\nnominated incumbent Associate Justice William Rehnquist to succeed Burger as Chief Justice\n(the appointment of an incumbent associate justice as chief justice is subject to a separate confirmation process).\nThen, following Rehnquist's confirmation, the president named Antonin Scalia to fill the consequent associate\njustice vacancy. Reagan's final opportunity to fill a vacancy arose in mid-1987 when Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell\nJr. announced his intention to retire. Reagan initially chose Conservative jurist Robert\nBork to succeed Powell. Bork's nomination was strongly opposed by civil and women's rights groups, and by Senate\nDemocrats. That October, after a contentious Senate debate, the nomination was rejected by a roll call vote\nof 42--58. Soon afterward, Reagan announced his intention to nominate Douglas Ginsburg to the\nCourt. However, before his name was submitted to the Senate, Ginsburg\nwithdrew himself from consideration. Anthony Kennedy was subsequently nominated and confirmed as Powell's successor.\n\nAlong with his four Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of\nappeals, and 290 judges to the United States district\ncourts. Early in his presidency, Reagan appointed Clarence M. Pendleton\nJr. of San Diego as the first African American to chair the\nUnited States Commission on Civil Rights. Pendleton\ntried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with\nReagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his tenure from\n1981 until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton soon aroused the ire of\nmany civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the\ncomparable worth proposal as being \"Looney Tunes\".\n",

Flying shards of glass\nhit Reagan, but he was not injured. Using media credentials, Springer\nintended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons\ntest in the Nevada desert the following day. Springer was the\nfounder of an anti-nuclear group called the *100th Monkey*. Following\nhis arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not\nexplain how Springer got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's\nlife at all times. Later, Springer pled guilty to reduced charges\nand said he had not meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He pled\nguilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret\nService, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.\n",

They regularly attended Bel Air Church and occasionally made\nappearances on behalf of the Republican Party; Reagan delivered a\nwell-received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention.\nPreviously, on November 4, 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential\nLibrary was dedicated and opened to the public. Five presidents and six first ladies attended\nthe dedication ceremonies, marking the first time that five presidents\nwere gathered in the same location. Reagan continued to speak\npublicly in favor of the Brady Bill; a constitutional amendment\nrequiring a balanced budget; and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment, which\nprohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president. In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom\nAward with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. His final public speech\noccurred on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington,\nD.C.; his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard\nNixon on April 27, 1994.\n",

    "text": "#### Announcement and reaction (1994) \n\nIn August 1994, at the age of 83, Reagan was diagnosed with\nAlzheimer's disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease which destroys brain cells and\nultimately causes death. In November of that year, he informed the nation of the diagnosis through a handwritten letter,\nwriting in part:\n\nAfter his diagnosis, letters of support from well-wishers poured into\nhis California home. However, there was also speculation over how\nlong Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. At a\nJune 1981 reception for mayors, not long after the assassination\nattempt, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Samuel Pierce by saying \"How are you, Mr.\nMayor? How are things in your city?\", although he later\nrealized his mistake. In a 2011 book titled *My Father at 100*,\nReagan's son Ron said he had suspected early signs of his father's dementia as early as 1984; an\nallegation that sparked a furious response from his brother, Michael\nReagan, who accused him of \"selling out his\nfather to sell books\". Ron would later temper his claims, telling\n*The New York Times* he did not believe his father was actually\ninhibited by Alzheimer's while in office, only that \"the disease was\nlikely present in him\", for years prior to his 1994 diagnoses.\nFormer CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that in her final meeting with\nthe president in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who she was.\nStahl claims that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, but by\nthe end of the meeting, he had regained his alertness.\n\nLay observations that Reagan suffered from Alzheimer's while still in\noffice have been widely refuted by medical experts, however, including\nthe many physicians who treated Reagan both during and after his\npresidency. Regarding his mental competency while in\noffice, all four of Reagan's White House doctors maintained they never\nhad any concerns \"even with the hindsight of\" the former president's\ndiagnosis. Neurosurgeon Daniel Ruge, who served as Physician to the President from 1981 to 1985,\nsaid that he never detected signs of the disease while speaking almost\nevery day with Reagan. John E. Hutton, who served from 1985 to\n1989, said the president \"absolutely\" did not \"show any signs of\ndementia or Alzheimer's\". Though all were familiar with the\ndisease, none of Reagan's White House physicians was an expert in\nAlzheimer's specifically; an outside specialist who reviewed both\nReagan's public and medical records agreed with the conclusion that he\ndisplayed no signs of dementia during his presidency. Reagan's\ndoctors said that he first began exhibiting overt symptoms of the\nillness in late\n1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. An example of\nwhich may include when Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher,\nwith identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on\nFebruary 6, 1993. Lawrence Altman (M.D.) of *The New York Times*,\nwhile noting that \"the line between mere forgetfulness and the\nbeginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy\", upon reviewing Reagan's\nmedical records and interviewing his doctors agreed that no signs of\ndementia appear to have been present while he was in office. Other\nstaff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of\nAlzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional\nmemory lapses, though, especially with names.\n\nReagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a\nhorse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy\nReagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease,\nalthough acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's\nor dementia. Ruge said it was possible that the horse accident affected Reagan's memory.\n",

He remained active, however; he took walks\nthrough parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and\nuntil 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City.\n\nReagan suffered a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001,\nresulting in a broken hip. The fracture was repaired the following\nday, and the 89-year-old Reagan returned home later that week,\nalthough he faced difficult physical therapy at home. On February\n6, 2001, Reagan reached the age of 90, becoming only the third U.S.\npresident after John Adams and Herbert Hoover to do so.\nReagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the\ndisease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet\nsemi-isolation with his wife Nancy. She told CNN's Larry\nKing in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed\nto see her husband because she felt that \"Ronnie would want people to\nremember him as he was.\" After her husband's diagnosis and\ndeath, Nancy Reagan became a stem-cell research advocate, asserting that it\ncould lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.\n",

    "text": "## Death and funeral \n\nReagan died of pneumonia, complicated by Alzheimer's disease, at his home in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, on the afternoon of June 5, 2004. A short time after his death, Nancy\nReagan released a statement saying, \"My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan\nhas died after 10 years of Alzheimer's disease at 93 years of age. We appreciate everyone's prayers.\" Speaking in\nParis, France, President George W. Bush called Reagan's death \"a sad hour in the life of America\". He also\ndeclared June 11 a national day of mourning.\n\nReagan's body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in\nSanta Monica, California, where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the\ngrass. On June 7, his body was transferred to the Ronald Reagan\nPresidential Library, where a brief family funeral, conducted by Pastor Michael\nWenning, was held. Reagan's body lay in\nrepose in the Library lobby until June 9; over 100,000 people viewed the\ncoffin. On June 9, Reagan's body was flown to Washington, D.C.,\nwhere he became the tenth U.S. president to lie in\nstate in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol; in thirty-four hours, 104,684 people filed past the coffin.\n\nOn June 11, a state funeral was\nconducted in the Washington National Cathedral, presided over by\nPresident George W. Bush. Eulogies were given by former British Prime\nMinister Margaret Thatcher, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian\nMulroney, and both former President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Also in attendance were Mikhail\nGorbachev and many world leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair; Prince Charles, representing his mother\nQueen Elizabeth II; German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der;\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi; and interim presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and\nGhazi al-Yawer of Iraq.\n\nAfter the funeral, the Reagan entourage was flown back to the Ronald W.\nReagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where another\nservice was held, and President Reagan was interred. At the time\nof his death, Reagan was the longest-lived\npresident in U.S. history, having lived 93 years and 120 days (2 years, 8 months, and\n23 days longer than John Adams, whose record he surpassed). He was also the first U.S. president to die in the 21st\ncentury. Reagan's burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered\nat the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library: \"I know in my\nheart that man is good, that what is right will always eventually\ntriumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life.\"\n",

    "text": "## Legacy\n\nSince Reagan left office in 1989, substantial debate has occurred among\nscholars, historians, and the general public surrounding his\nlegacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous\neconomy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy\ntriumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a\nrestoration of American pride and morale. Proponents say that he\nhad an unabated and passionate love for the United States which restored\nfaith in the American Dream, after a decline in American\nconfidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak\nleadership, particularly during the Iran hostage\ncrisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary\noutlook for the future of the United States during the 1980\nelection. Critics point out that Reagan's economic policies\nresulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in\nwealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the\nIran--Contra affair lowered American credibility.\n\nOpinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policymakers\nand journalists differ as well. Edwin\nFeulner, president of The Heritage\nFoundation, said that Reagan\n\"helped create a safer, freer world\" and said of his economic\npolicies: \"He took an America suffering from\n'malaise'... and made its citizens believe\nagain in their destiny.\" However, Mark\nWeisbrot, co-Director of the Center for\nEconomic and Policy Research, contended\nthat Reagan's \"economic policies were mostly a failure\" while\nHoward Kurtz of *The Washington Post* opined that Reagan was \"a far\nmore controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on\ntelevision would suggest\".\n\nDespite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative\nand liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential\npresident since Franklin D. Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on\nAmerican politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his\neffective communication and pragmatic compromising. As summarized\nby British historian M. J. Heale, since Reagan left office, historians\nhave reached a broad consensus that he rehabilitated conservatism,\nturned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic\nconservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and\nAmerican exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.\n",

    "text": "### Cold War \n\nIn 2017, a C-SPAN survey of scholars ranked Reagan in terms of\nleadership in comparison with all 42 presidents. He ranked number nine\nin international relations.\n\nReagan's major achievement was the end of the Cold War as he left\noffice. Furthermore, the USSR and Soviet-sponsored Communist movements\nworldwide were falling apart---and collapsed completely three years\nafter he left office. The U.S. thus became the only superpower. His\nadmirers say he won the Cold War. After 40 years of high tension,\nthe USSR pulled back in the last years of Reagan's second term. In\n1989, the Kremlin lost control of all its East European satellites. In\n1991, Communism was overthrown in the USSR, and on December 26, 1991,\nthe Soviet Union ceased to exist. The resulting states were no threat to\nthe United States. Reagan's exact role is debated, with many believing\nthat Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies\nand hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism---together\nwith his summits with General Secretary Gorbachev---played a significant\npart in ending the Cold War.\n\nHe was the first president to reject containment and d\u00e9tente and to put\ninto practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather\nthan simply negotiated with, a post-D\u00e9tente strategy, a conviction\nthat was vindicated by Gennadi Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman\nunder Gorbachev, who said that the Strategic Defense\nInitiative was \"very successful blackmail....The Soviet economy\ncouldn't endure such competition.\" Reagan's aggressive rhetoric\ntoward the USSR had mixed effects; Jeffery W. Knopf observes that being\nlabeled \"evil\" probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave\nencouragement to the East-European citizens opposed to communism.\n\nGeneral Secretary Gorbachev said of his former rival's Cold War role:\n\"He was a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War\",\nand deemed him \"a great president\". Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful\nend; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric.\nMargaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United\nKingdom, said of Reagan, \"he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for\nmilitary power... but he also sensed it was being\neaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform.\" She later\nsaid, \"Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have\nwon the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being\nfired.\" Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada:\n\"He enters history as a strong and dramatic player in The Cold War.\" Former President\nLech Wa\u0142\u0119sa of Poland acknowledged, \"Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to\ncommunism's collapse.\" Professor Jeffrey Knopf has argued that\nReagan's leadership was only one of several causes of the end of the Cold War.\nPresident Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also\nregarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.\n",

    "text": "### Domestic and political legacy \n\nReagan reshaped the Republican party, led the modern conservative\nmovement, and altered the political dynamic of the United States. More men voted Republican\nunder Reagan, and Reagan tapped into religious voters. The so-called \"Reagan Democrats\" were a result of his presidency.\n\nAfter leaving office, Reagan became an iconic influence within the\nRepublican Party. His policies and beliefs have been frequently\ninvoked by Republican presidential candidates since 1988. The 2008 Republican presidential candidates\nwere no exception, for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the\nprimary debates, even imitating his campaign strategies. Republican nominee John McCain frequently said\nthat he came to office as \"a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution\".\nReagan's most famous statement regarding the role of smaller government was that \"Government is not a solution to our\nproblem, government is the problem.\"\nPraise for Reagan's accomplishments was part of standard GOP rhetoric a quarter-century\nafter his retirement. *Washington Post* reporter Carlos Lozada noted how the main\nRepublican contenders in the 2016 presidential race adopted \"standard GOP Gipper worship\".\n\nThe period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies\nthat concerned taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the\nCold War is known today as the Reagan Era. This time period emphasized that the\nconservative \"Reagan Revolution\", led by Reagan, had a permanent\nimpact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy.\nThe Bill Clinton administration is often treated as an extension of the Reagan Era, as is the George W. Bush\nadministration. Historian Eric Foner noted that the Obama\ncandidacy in 2008 \"aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those\nyearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism\".\n",

His role in the Cold War further enhanced his\nimage as a different kind of leader. Reagan's \"avuncular\nstyle, optimism, and plain-folks demeanor\" also helped him turn\n\"government-bashing into an art form\".\n\nReagan's popularity has increased since 1989. When Reagan left office\nin 1989, a CBS poll indicated that he held an approval rating of 68\npercent. This figure equaled the approval rating of Franklin D.\nRoosevelt (and was later matched by\nBill Clinton, as the highest rating for a\ndeparting president in the modern era.\nGallup polls in 2001, 2007 and 2011\nranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for\nthe greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of\npost-World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen\nReports poll, fifth in a 2000 ABC poll,\nninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late-2008 poll by\nBritish newspaper *The Times*. In a Siena College survey of over 200\nhistorians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42.\nWhile the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual\n*C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders* ranked\nReagan the tenth-greatest president. The survey of leading historians\nrated Reagan number 11 in 2000.\n\nIn 2011, the Institute for the Study of the\nAmericas released the first-ever British academic survey to rate U.S. presidents. This\npoll of British specialists in U.S. history and politics placed Reagan\nas the eighth-greatest U.S. president.\n\nReagan's ability to talk about substantive issues with understandable\nterms and to focus on mainstream American concerns earned him the\nlaudatory moniker \"The Great Communicator\". Of it,\nReagan said, \"I won the nickname the great communicator. But I never\nthought it was my style that made a difference---it was the content. I\nwasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things.\"\nHis age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.\n\nReagan also earned the nickname \"the Teflon President\", in that public\nperceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose\nduring his administration. According to Colorado congresswoman\nPatricia Schroeder, who coined the phrase, the epithet referred to Reagan's ability to \"do almost\nanything and not get blamed for it\".\n\nPublic reaction to Reagan was always mixed. He was the oldest president\nup to that time and was supported by young voters, who began an alliance\nthat shifted many of them to the Republican Party. Reagan did not\nfare well with minority groups in terms of approval, especially African\nAmericans. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency\nearned him support from many Jews. He emphasized\nfamily values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been\ndivorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed\npatriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media,\nplayed an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy.\n\nReagan was known to joke frequently during his lifetime, displayed humor\nthroughout his presidency, and was famous for his\nstorytelling. His numerous jokes and\none-liners have been labeled \"classic\nquips\" and \"legendary\". Among the most notable of his jokes was\none regarding the Cold War. As a microphone test in preparation for his\nweekly radio address in August 1984, Reagan made the following joke: \"My fellow Americans,\nI'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will\noutlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\"\nReagan's sense of humor was also observed by hundreds of Americans at Tempelhof\nU.S. Air Base June 12, 1987. While giving a speech celebrating the 750th\nanniversary of Berlin, a balloon popped in the front row. Without\nmissing a beat, Reagan quipped \"missed me\", a reference to his\nprevious assassination attempt in 1981. Former aide David Gergen\ncommented, \"It was that humor... that I think endeared people to Reagan.\"\n\nHe also had the ability to offer comfort and hope to the nation as a\nwhole at times of tragedy. Following the disintegration of the Space\nShuttle *Challenger* on January\n28, 1986. On the evening of the disaster, Reagan addressed the\nnation saying, The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave ...\nWe will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye\nand \"slipped the surly bonds of Earth\" to \"touch the face of God\n",

In 1982 he was given the\n\"Distinguished Service Medal\" by the American\nLegion because his highest priority was the\nnational defense. In 1983, he received the highest distinction of\nthe Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.\nIn 1989, Reagan was made an honorary knight Grand Cross of the\nOrder of the Bath, one of the highest British orders. This entitled him to the use of the post-nominal letters\n\"GCB\" but, as a foreign national, not to be known as \"Sir Ronald\nReagan\". Only two U.S. presidents have received this honor since\nattaining office: Reagan and George H. W. Bush; Dwight D.\nEisenhower received his before\nbecoming president in his capacity as a general after World War II.\nReagan was also named an honorary Fellow of Keble College, Oxford. Japan awarded him the Grand\nCordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1989; he was\nthe second U.S. president to receive the order and the first to have it\ngiven to him for personal reasons as Eisenhower received it as a\ncommemoration of U.S.--Japanese relations. In 1990, Reagan was\nawarded the WPPAC's Top Honor Prize because he signed the\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with H.E. Mikhail Gorbachev\n(then president of Russia), ending the cold war.\n\nOn January 18, 1993, Reagan received the Presidential Medal of\nFreedom (awarded with distinction), the highest honor that the United States can bestow, from\nPresident George H. W. Bush, his vice president and successor.\nReagan was also awarded the Republican Senatorial Medal of Freedom, the\nhighest honor bestowed by Republican members of the Senate.\n\nOn Reagan's 87th birthday in 1998, Washington National Airport was\nrenamed Ronald Reagan Washington National\nAirport by a bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton.\nThat year, the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center\nwas dedicated in Washington, D.C. He was among 18 included in Gallup's most admired man and woman\npoll of the 20th century, from a poll conducted in the U.S. in 1999; two years later,\nUSS Ronald Reagan was christened by Nancy Reagan and the United States Navy. It\nis one of few Navy ships christened in honor of a living person and the first aircraft carrier to be named in\nhonor of a living former president.\n\nIn 1998 the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Reagan its\nNaval Heritage award for his support of the U.S. Navy and military in\nboth his film career and while he served as president.\n\nCongress authorized the creation of the Ronald Reagan Boyhood\nHome in Dixon, Illinois in 2002, pending federal purchase of the property. On May 16 of that year,\nNancy Reagan accepted the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor\nbestowed by Congress, on behalf of the president and herself.\n\nAfter Reagan's death, the United States Postal Service issued a President\nRonald Reagan commemorative postage stamp in 2005. Later in the\nyear, CNN, along with the editors of *Time* magazine,\nnamed him the \"most fascinating person\" of the network's first 25\nyears; *Time* listed Reagan one of the 100 Most Important People\nof the 20th century as well. The Discovery\nChannel asked its viewers to vote for\nThe Greatest American in June 2005;\nReagan placed in first place, ahead of Abraham\nLincoln and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn 2006, Reagan was inducted into the California Hall of\nFame, located at The California Museum. Every year from 2002,\nCalifornia governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger proclaimed February 6\n\"Ronald Reagan Day\" in the state of California in honor of their most\nfamous predecessor. In 2010, Schwarzenegger signed Senate Bill 944,\nauthored by Senator George Runner, to make every February 6 Ronald Reagan Day in California.\n\nIn 2007, Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski\nposthumously conferred on Reagan the highest Polish distinction, the\nOrder of the White Eagle, saying that Reagan\nhad inspired the Polish people to work for change and helped to unseat\nthe repressive communist regime; Kaczy\u0144ski said it \"would not have been\npossible if it was not for the tough-mindedness, determination, and\nfeeling of mission of President Ronald Reagan\". Reagan backed the\nnation of Poland throughout his presidency, supporting the\nanti-communist Solidarity movement, along with Pope John Paul II; the Ronald Reagan Park,\na public facility in Gda\u0144sk, was named in his honor.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Nancy Reagan unveiled a statue of her late husband in\nthe United States Capitol rotunda. The statue\nrepresents the state of California in the National Statuary Hall Collection.\nAfter Reagan's death, both major American political parties agreed to erect a\nstatue of Reagan in the place of that of Thomas Starr\nKing. The day before, President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act into law,\nestablishing a commission to plan activities to mark the upcoming centenary of Reagan's birth.\n\nOn Independence Day 2011 a statue to Reagan was unveiled outside the U.S. embassy in\nLondon. The unveiling was supposed to be attended by Reagan's wife Nancy, but she did not\nattend; former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice took her place and read a statement\non her behalf. President Reagan's friend and British prime minister\nduring his presidency, Margaret Thatcher, was also unable to attend due\nto frail health.\n\nIn November 2018, a feature film named *Reagan* received funding from\nTriStar Global Entertainment with Dennis Quaid portraying Reagan.\nThis would be the second time Quaid portrayed a U.S. president.\n*Reagan* was scheduled to begin filming in May 2020, but was postponed\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

    "text": "### Religion\n\nRonald Reagan wrote that his mother \"always expected to find the best\nin people and often did\". She attended the Disciples of\nChrist church regularly and was active,\nand very influential, within it; she frequently led Sunday school\nservices and gave the Bible readings to the congregation during the\nservices. A firm believer in the power of prayer,\nshe led prayer meetings at church and was in charge of mid-week prayers\nwhen the pastor was out of town. She was also an adherent of the\nSocial Gospel movement. Her strong\ncommitment to the church is what induced her son Ronald to become a\nProtestant Christian rather than a Roman Catholic like his Irish\nfather. He also stated that she strongly influenced his own\nbeliefs: \"I know that she planted that faith very deeply in me.\"\nReagan identified himself as a born-again Christian. In Dixon,\nReagan was strongly influenced by his pastor Beh Hill Cleaver, an\nerudite scholar. Cleaver was the father of Reagan's fianc\u00e9e. Reagan saw\nhim as a second father. Stephen Vaughn says:\n\n    At many points the positions taken by the First Christian Church of\n    Reagan's youth coincided with the words, if not the beliefs of the\n    latter-day Reagan. These positions included faith in Providence,\n    association of America's mission with God's will, belief in\n    progress, trust in the work ethic and admiration for those who\n    achieved wealth, an uncomfortableness with literature and art that\n    questioned the family or challenged notions of proper sexual\n    behavior, presumption that poverty is an individual problem best\n    left to charity rather than the state, sensitivity to problems\n    involving alcohol and drugs, and reticence to use government to\n    protect civil rights for minorities.\n\nAccording to Paul Kengor, Reagan had a\nparticularly strong faith in the goodness of people; this faith stemmed\nfrom the optimistic faith of his mother and the Disciples of\nChrist faith, into which he was\nbaptized in 1922. For that period, which was long before the civil\nrights movement, Reagan's opposition\nto racial discrimination was unusual. He recalled the time when his college football team was staying\nat a local hotel which would not allow two black teammates to stay\nthere, and he invited them to his parents' home 15 miles (24 kilometers) away in Dixon. His mother\ninvited them to stay overnight and have breakfast the next morning.\nHis father was strongly opposed to the Ku Klux Klan due to his Catholic heritage, but also\ndue to the Klan's anti-semitism and anti-black racism.\nAfter becoming a prominent actor, Reagan gave speeches in favor of\nracial equality following World War II.\n",
